# Bartender

Bartender is a small scripting language made to be embedded in projects such as Discord bots or a 
website like [discohook.org](https://discohook.org). It should be used when you want more than 
just letting a user specify a message but don't want to let them write JavaScript that is 
evaluated on the server/client. E.g, my Discord bot Crossant uses Bartender to allow users to 
define a message that the bot will put in their self-roles channel that allows them to 
consistently format it without writing the whole message theirself.
